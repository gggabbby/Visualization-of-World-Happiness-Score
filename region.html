                                Among them, countries in the northern region scored higher, countries in the south scored lower, 
                                and the corresponding GDP per Capita and Health Life Expectancy bar charts showed a 
                                positive correlation between these two factors and the happiness index.

                                happiness in the Eastern Asia region, from 4.8 to 6.4 points. Among them, inland areas have 
                                relatively low scores, and coastal areas have relatively high scores. And the corresponding 
                                GDP per Capita and Health Life Expectancy bar charts also show a positive correlation between

                                As can be seen from the chart, the happiness index in the Middle East and Northern 
                                Africa regions ranges from 3 to 7.2 points, with a significant differentiation between the 
                                two levels. Some countries in the central region scored higher, while others in the 
                                surrounding region scored lower. The corresponding GDP per Capita and Health Life Expectancy

                Conclusion of Regions Happiness

                As can be seen from the chart of happiness index changes of Western Europe, Eastern Asia, Middle East and 
                Northern Africa from 2015 to 2019, there is a certain gap in the happiness index scores of each region. 
                Most countries in the Western Europe region had higher happiness scores, and a small number had lower happiness 
                scores. In Eastern Asia, happiness scores are concentrated on a scale of five to six. In the Middle East 
                and Northern Africa, happiness scores were almost evenly split between high and low. The corresponding 
                GDP per Capita and Health Life Expectancy bar charts show a positive correlation between happiness and 
                the scores of these two factors. Therefore, it can be learned that the happiness in the hearts of the people 
                and he lives in which region of the earth is not too directly related, happiness feelings more mainly 
                depends on the economic level of the living area and the health level of the individual has a great relationship.
