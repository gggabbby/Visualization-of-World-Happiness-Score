            <p style="font-size: 14px; padding: 0 50px 0 50px; text-align: justify;">
                As governments, organizations and social institutions increasingly use happiness scores as a reference to 
                adjust their decisions, the World Happiness Report has become increasingly important. Experts in statistics, 
                economics, public policy, psychology and other related fields have also pointed out that a 
                country's happiness score is closely related to its development and progress. Therefore, this project 
                will use the happiness index reports of more than 150 countries in the five years from 2015 to 2019 to 
                analyze what makes people happy and why a country's happiness index is closely related to national development. 
                This project is mainly divided into three parts: Global happiness, Happiness Factors, and Regions Happiness. 
                Global happiness mainly displays the changes in the happiness index of countries around the world from 2015 to 2019. 
                In the Happiness Factors interface, the top ten and last ten countries in 2019 are selected, 
                and the five factors that determine the degree of happiness are visualized to show the relationship between 
                the happiness index and these factors. The third part, Regions Happiness, is mainly used to show the differences 
                between the happiness index and the corresponding two determinants in three different regions of the world.
