                                As can be seen from the figure, in 2019, the top ten countries in the 
                                happiness index are Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Netherlands, Switzerland, 
                                Sweden, New, Zealand, Canada and Austria. They all scored above 7.2, 
                                and the highest score was Finland, reaching nearly 7.77 points. The last ten countries 
                                in the happiness index are Haiti, Botswana, Syria, Malawi, Yemen, Rwanda, Tanzania, 
                                Afghanistan, Central African Republic and South Sudan. Their scores are all less than 3.6. 
                                This is nearly half the gap with countries with high levels of happiness.

                                It can be seen from the above two graphs that the GDP per 
                                Capita growth trend of the top 10 countries is close to the same, 
                                showing an upward trend from 2015 to 2017, a decline from 2017 to 2018, and then 
                                a rebound trend in 2019. The GDP per Capita trend of the last 10 countries is not regular, 
                                and the score gap is large. For example, Botswana showed an upward trend from 2015 to 2017, 
                                while the Central African Republic showed a downward trend in these three years.

                                AIt can be seen from the above two graphs that the Health Life Expectancy growth trend 
                                of the top 10 countries is close to the same, showing a decline trend from 2015 to 2017, 
                                an upward trend from 2017 to 2019. The Health Life Trend in last10 countries is different. 
                                But in 2018 to 2019, Health Life Expectancy is on the rise trend in nine countries, 
                                with the exception of Syria.

                                From the figure, the Freedom to Make Life Choice trend in top 10 countries is similar 
                                and the scores are similar. It showed a downward trend in 2015 to 2016, an upward trend 
                                in 2016-18 and a downward trend in 2018 to 2019. Although the last 10 countries have large 
                                differences in scores, most countries have had the same trend in The Freedom to Make Life Choice 
                                in recent years, that is, decline first, then rise, then fall.

                                From the chart, it can be seen that the top 10 countries have different trends in 
                                Perceptions of Corruption, and there is a large gap between the scores of different countries. 
                                But the overall trend is flattening out. Nine of the last 10 countries had Perceptions 
                                of Corruption scores between 0 and 0.2 over the years, with the exception of Rwanda. 
                                Rwanda's Perceptions of Corruption scores have fallen sharply over the years.

                                As can be seen from the figure, the score of the top 10 countries and the last 10 countries 
                                showed a similar trend from 2015 to 2019 in Generosity. It showed a slow upward trend from 2015 to 2017, and a 
                                downward trend from 2017 to 2018. It rose from 2018 to 2019, but the final score was not as 
                                high as that of 2015.  At the same time, it can be seen that the scores of most of the last 
                                10 countries are not significantly different from those of the top 10 countries.

                Conclusion of Happiness Factors
            </h3>
            <p style="font-size: 14px; padding: 10px 40px 40px 40px; text-align: justify;">
                From 2015 to 2019 GDP per Capita Per Capita Lifey Comparison, Freedom to Make Life Choice Choice Comparison, 
                Perceptions of Corruption Comparison, Generosity Comparison diagram can be seen, there is a clear gap between 
                the happiness index top 10 countries and the happiness index last 10 countries in terms of GDP per Capita, 
                Health Life and Freedom to Make Life Choice, with no significant contrast pattern in Pers of Corruption and a 
                smaller gap in Generosity.  This suggests that while Perceptions of Corruption and Generosity have an impact on 
                personal well-being, the main factors that affect GDP are GDP Per Capita, Health Life and Freedom to Make Life 
                Choice. At the same time, it can be found that the happiness index top 10 countries are mainly concentrated in 
                the western developed countries, which also proved that the economically good region people live a happier life.
